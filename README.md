# Neuroscience-Analysis-Class
Hands-on tutorials designed to teach common analysis techniques in academic Neuroscience research. Designed & Co-taught by Bart Massi and Genevieve Yang. 

The syllabus contains a brief description of the overall goals of the course, and what type of skills are taught each week. Each tutorial is VERY heavily annotated, as it was meant to be used as a comprehensive lesson on a particular topic.

The folders, labeled by week, contain the tutorials given to students with answers filled in. Necessary data files and functions are also included.

I have only included tutorials that I personally designed and wrote; Genevieve wrote the remaining tutorials. These tutorials mostly focus on analysis of choice behavior, and rudimentary model fitting & model selection.
